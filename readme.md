# Traveling salesman problem (TSP) solving algorithms
 
This repository contains C++ implementation of TSP solving metaheuristic algorithms. 

# TSP
Traveling salesman problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve it program needs to find lowest cost hamiltionian cycle in full graph.

# Implemented algorithms

- Tabu Search
- Simmulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm
